		"To be able to make use of the molten metals in your smeltery, you need to cast them into shape.",
		"There are many different types of cast -- and they are created by melting gold or brass in the smeltery, then pouring the liquid over an item you want to make a cast of onto a casting table.",
		"e.g. to make an ingot cast, place any sort of ingot onto the casting table, then pour the gold/brass over the top.",
		"",
		"This process can make plates slightly more efficiently than the Plate Press -- dropping the ingot requirement down to 4 ingots per plate."
