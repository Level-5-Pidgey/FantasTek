		"An Everfull Urn will serve as an incredibly useful tool for the budding Thaumaturge (and even Botanists too) as it will automatically fill up a nearby Crucible. The Urn is effectively a bottomless bucket of water, so you will be able to pipe water out of it and and use it to automatically refill your equipment for faster researching."
